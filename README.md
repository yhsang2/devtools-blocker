# 🔒 Developer Tools Blocker (F12 & DevTools Protection Script)

This JavaScript snippet prevents users from opening browser developer tools  
such as **F12**, **Ctrl + Shift + I**, **Ctrl + U**, and various platform-specific shortcuts.  
It also includes a detection mechanism that alerts the user if DevTools is triggered.

> ⚠️ **Important Note:**  
> This script does *not* guarantee perfect protection against advanced users or developers.  
> It is only effective for deterring general users and preventing accidental DevTools access.

> It only discourages casual or novice users from opening DevTools.

- 🔧 Browser vendors may change DevTools internals, reducing reliability  
- 🔒 Should **not** be used in security-critical environments  
- 🧪 Best suited for:
